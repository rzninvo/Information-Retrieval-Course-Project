This project was carried out as part of the Information Retrieval course.
## Dataset
There are two datasets. One has 7k news articles, and the second one has 50k news articles used for clustering. Articles in the second dataset have categories (`sport`, `economy`, `politics`, `culture`, and `health`), and they were used in `KNN` for labeling articles in the first dataset. Datasets are not in this repository.
The dataset used in the first and second phase of the project was "IR1_7k_news.xlsx", while "IR00_3_11k News.xlsx" was one of the three datasets used in the third phase. The Hazm library was utilized for Persian language processing.  

## First Phase:
In the first phase of the project, a boolean information retrieval system was implemented using a positional index. The following preprocessings were carried out:

- Normalization
- Tokenization
- Stemming  
## Second Phase:
The second phase involved the implementation of a ranking information retrieval system based on vector space.

## Third Phase:
In the third phase, the vector space model was enhanced using word embeddings. Additionally, categorization and clustering were incorporated into the system.
